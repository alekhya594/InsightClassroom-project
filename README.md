## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Students** register and log in via the web interface.
2. On the **Home page**, students write feedback, select the relevant department and teacher, and submit.
3. The feedback is processed by a trained **Machine Learning sentiment classifier**, categorizing it as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
4. The system saves the feedback along with its sentiment to the database for analysis.
